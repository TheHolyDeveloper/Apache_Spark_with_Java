# Apache_Spark_with_Java
Get processing Big Data using RDDs, DataFrames, SparkSQL and Machine Learning - and real time streaming with Kafka!

# What I learnt?
Use functional style Java to define complex data processing jobs. <br />
Learn the differences between the RDD and DataFrame APIs. <br />
Use an SQL style syntax to produce reports against Big Data sets. <br />
Use Machine Learning Algorithms with Big Data and SparkML. <br />
Connect Spark to Apache Kafka to process Streams of Big Data. <br />
See how Structured Streaming can be used to build pipelines with Kafka. <br />

# Technical Requirements
Java 8 is required. Spark does not currently support Java9+, and you need Java 8 for the functional Lambda syntax. <br />
Knowledge of basic SQL Syntax.

# Software Requirements
IDE (Eclipse/Intellij) <br />
Apache Kafka <br />
Maven
