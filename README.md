# Apache_Spark_with_Java
Get processing Big Data using RDDs, DataFrames, SparkSQL and Machine Learning - and real time streaming with Kafka!

# What I learnt?
Use functional style Java to define complex data processing jobs.
Learn the differences between the RDD and DataFrame APIs.
Use an SQL style syntax to produce reports against Big Data sets.
Use Machine Learning Algorithms with Big Data and SparkML.
Connect Spark to Apache Kafka to process Streams of Big Data.
See how Structured Streaming can be used to build pipelines with Kafka.

# Technical Requirements
Java 8 is required. Spark does not currently support Java9+, and you need Java 8 for the functional Lambda syntax.
Knowledge of basic SQL Syntax.

# Software Requirements
IDE (Eclipse/Intellij)
Apache Kafka
Maven
